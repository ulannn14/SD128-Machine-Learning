To balance the categories of the dataset, some images were removed from subsets that have sufficient data, to keep 60 images at each category at most despite the initial collection of 10,000 clinical skin disease images. Further filtration of the images was then done by removing duplicates and low-quality images. The SD-198 dataset was then finalized with 6,584 images and 198 different skin disease categories."

    "This confirms that adding more neurons does not necessarily translate to better performance, especially when the input space is already large. For datasets like ours, the model already processes rich information, and expanding the hidden layer only increases parameters without yielding stronger representations. Such an approach typically benefits smaller or lower-dimensional datasets, where additional neurons help create more expressive mappings. In this case, the result further supports that the decreasing architecture remains more appropriate for high-dimensional data, while increasing architectures may only show improvement in settings with limited input features."

    "To improve the performance of the neural network model, a systematic hyperparameter tuning process was conducted. Hyperparameter tuning aims to identify the combination of settings that produces the highest validation accuracy without overfitting or excessive training time. A higher learning rate (e.g., 0.1) leads to faster convergence but risks overshooting the optimal point, while a smaller rate (e.g., 0.005) ensures more stable and precise updates but requires more iterations. The goal was to find a balance between speed and stability. Three different hidden layer configurations were evaluated to test the model’s representational capacity testing for moderate learning capacity to testing performance improvement.\n"
